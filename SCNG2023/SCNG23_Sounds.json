The Reflections Gain property does not affect the subsequent reverberation decay.

The direction of this vector controls the global direction of the reflections, while its magnitude controls how focused the reflections are towards this direction. It is important to note that the direction of the vector is interpreted in the coordinate system of the user, without taking into account the orientation of the virtual listener. For instance, assuming a four-point loudspeaker playback system, setting Reflections Pan to (0., 0., 0.7) means that the reflections are panned to the front speaker pair, whereas as setting of (0., 0., −0.7) pans the reflections towards the rear speakers. These vectors follow the a left-handed co-ordinate system, unlike OpenAL uses a right-handed co-ordinate system. If the magnitude of Reflections Pan is zero (the default setting), the early reflections come evenly from all directions. As the magnitude increases, the reflections become more focused in the direction pointed to by the vector.

Setting the Room Rolloff Factor value to 1.0 specifies that the reflected sound will decay by 6 dB every time the distance doubles. Any value other than 1.0 is equivalent to a scaling factor applied to the quantity specified by ((Source listener distance) - (Reference Distance)). Reference Distance is an OpenAL source parameter that specifies the inner border for distance rolloff effects: if the source comes closer to the listener than the reference distance, the direct-path sound isn’t increased as the source comes closer to the listener, and neither is the reflected sound.

This limit, when on, maintains a natural sounding reverberation decay by allowing you to increase the value of Decay Time without the risk of getting an unnaturally long decay time at high frequencies.

It is important to note that the direction of the vector is interpreted in the coordinate system of the user, without taking into account the orientation of the virtual listener. For instance, assuming a four-point loudspeaker playback system, setting Reflections Pan to (0., 0., 0.7) means that the reflections are panned to the front speaker pair, whereas as setting of (0., 0., −0.7) pans the reflections towards the rear speakers. These vectors follow the a left-handed co-ordinate system, unlike OpenAL uses a right-handed co-ordinate system. If the magnitude of Reflections Pan is zero (the default setting), the early reflections come evenly from all directions.

Setting the Room Rolloff Factor value to 1.0 specifies that the reflected sound will decay by 6 dB every time the distance doubles.
